## Introduction

The **IP Info Dashboard** is a web application built using **FastAPI** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. It provides a simple and interactive interface to view key information about the user's network connection, including:

- Local IP address
- Public IP address
- Geolocation based on the public IP (city, region, and country)

This project serves as a tool for quickly retrieving your network details and understanding your connection better, especially when working with networking applications, diagnosing issues, or testing different configurations.
